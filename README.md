Introduction:
As an innovation-driven individual, I am excited about the ongoing AI revolution! In particular, the emergence of openAI, Langchain and Vectorstore solutions like Pineccone or ChromaDB makes it possible to develop AI applications with ease. 
That's why I started this side project exploring the potential of Machine Learning in HR. Here I am working on the creation of competence profiles of applicants (based on CVs), job postings, and entire projects (based on Jira Stories) to enable the best possible matching.

Keyword-Search:
An exemplary insight into this project is provided by a module for competence screening or competence clustering of CVs, which is currently still in progress and is being developed as a proof of concept, but which immediately demonstrates the potential of vector embedding, especially with the help of large language models.

NER:
For the creation of employee and project competence profiles, we recommend the use of information extraction algorithms (e.g. Named Entity Recognition) using the spaCy library.
